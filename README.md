THis program takes input and determines which number is greater or less

Peer Reviewed by Jovann
The code validated for both numbers it gave the correct answers and checked if either they were less than greater than or equal too. The play again worked good I would of liked if the play again was validated to make sure they implemented the right commands, other then that the code ran good.
